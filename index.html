                <h2>This is the timeline of BOB Marle</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>1962–72 - </b> <br> In February 1962, Marley recorded four songs, "Judge Not", "One Cup of
                        Coffee", "Do You Still Love Me?" and "Terror", at Federal Studios for local music producer Leslie
                        Kong.[33] Three of the songs were released on Beverley's with "One Cup of Coffee" being released
                        under the pseudonym Bobby Martell.[34]

                        In 1963, Bob Marley, Bunny Wailer, Peter Tosh, Junior Braithwaite, Beverley Kelso, and Cherry Smith
                        were called the Teenagers. They later changed the name to the Wailing Rudeboys, then to the Wailing
                        Wailers, at which point they were discovered by record producer Coxsone Dodd, and finally to the
                        Wailers. Their single "Simmer Down" for the Coxsone label became a Jamaican No. 1 in February 1964
                        selling an estimated 70,000 copies.[35] The Wailers, now regularly recording for Studio One, found
                        themselves working with established Jamaican musicians such as Ernest Ranglin (arranger "It Hurts To
                        Be Alone"),[36] the keyboardist Jackie Mittoo and saxophonist Roland Alphonso. By 1966, Braithwaite,
                        Kelso, and Smith had left the Wailers, leaving the core trio of Bob Marley, Bunny Wailer, and Peter
                        Tosh.</li>
                    <li><b>1972–74: Move to Island Records :</b> <br> In 1972, Bob Marley signed with CBS Records in London
                        and embarked on a UK tour with soul singer Johnny Nash.[44] While in London the Wailers asked their
                        road manager Brent Clarke to introduce them to Chris Blackwell, who had licensed some of their
                        Coxsone releases for his Island Records. The Wailers intended to discuss the royalties associated
                        with these releases; instead, the meeting resulted in the offer of an advance of £4,000 to record an
                        album.[45] Since Jimmy Cliff, Island's top reggae star, had recently left the label, Blackwell was
                        primed for a replacement. In Marley, Blackwell recognised the elements needed to snare the rock
                        audience: "I was dealing with rock music, which was really rebel music. I felt that would really be
                        the way to break Jamaican music. But you needed someone who could be that image. When Bob walked in
                        he really was that image."[46] The Wailers returned to Jamaica to record at Harry J's in Kingston,
                        which resulted in the album Catch a Fire.

                    </li>
                    <li><b>1974–76: Line-up changes and shooting</b> <br> Despite the break-up, Marley continued recording
                        as "Bob Marley & The Wailers". His new backing band included brothers Carlton and Aston "Family Man"
                        Barrett on drums and bass respectively, Junior Marvin and Al Anderson on lead guitar, Tyrone Downie
                        and Earl "Wya" Lindo on keyboards, and Alvin "Seeco" Patterson on percussion. The "I Threes",
                        consisting of Judy Mowatt, Marcia Griffiths, and Marley's wife, Rita, provided backing vocals. In
                        1975, Marley had his international breakthrough with his first hit outside Jamaica, with a live
                        version of "No Woman, No Cry", from the Live! album.[51] This was followed by his breakthrough album
                        in the United States, Rastaman Vibration (1976), which reached the Top 50 of the Billboard Soul
                        Charts.[52]

                        On 3 December 1976, two days before "Smile Jamaica", a free concert organised by the Jamaican Prime
                        Minister Michael Manley in an attempt to ease tension between two warring political groups, Marley,
                        his wife, and manager Don Taylor were wounded in an assault by unknown gunmen inside Marley's home.
                        Taylor and Marley's wife sustained serious injuries but later made full recoveries. Bob Marley
                        received minor wounds in the chest and arm.[53] The attempt on his life was thought to have been
                        politically motivated, as many felt the concert was really a support rally for Manley. Nonetheless,
                        the concert proceeded, and an injured Marley performed as scheduled, two days after the attempt.
                        When asked why, Marley responded, "The people who are trying to make this world worse aren't taking
                        a day off. How can I?" The members of the group Zap Pow played as Bob Marley's backup band before a
                        festival crowd of 80,000 while members of The Wailers were still missing or in hiding.</li>
                    <li><b>1976–79: Relocation to England</b><br>Marley left Jamaica at the end of 1976, and after a
                        month-long "recovery and writing" sojourn at the site of Chris Blackwell's Compass Point Studios in
                        Nassau, Bahamas, arrived in England, where he spent two years in self-imposed exile.

                        Whilst in England, he recorded the albums Exodus and Kaya. Exodus stayed on the British album charts
                        for 56 consecutive weeks. It included four UK hit singles: "Exodus", "Waiting in Vain", "Jamming",
                        and "One Love" (which interpolates Curtis Mayfield's hit, "People Get Ready"). During his time in
                        London, he was arrested and received a conviction for possession of a small quantity of
                        cannabis.[56] In 1978, Marley returned to Jamaica and performed at another political concert, the
                        One Love Peace Concert, again in an effort to calm warring parties. Near the end of the performance,
                        by Marley's request, Michael Manley (leader of then-ruling People's National Party) and his
                        political rival Edward Seaga (leader of the opposing Jamaica Labour Party) joined each other on
                        stage and shook hands.</li>
                    <li><b>1979–81: Later years</b><br>a defiant and politically charged album, was released in 1979. Tracks
                        such as "Zimbabwe", "Africa Unite", "Wake Up and Live", and "Survival" reflected Marley's support
                        for the struggles of Africans. His appearance at the Amandla Festival in Boston in July 1979 showed
                        his strong opposition to South African apartheid, which he already had shown in his song "War" in
                        1976. In early 1980, he was invited to perform at 17 April celebration of Zimbabwe's Independence
                        Day.[60]

                        Uprising (1980) was Bob Marley's final studio album, and is one of his most religious productions;
                        it includes "Redemption Song" and "Forever Loving Jah".[61] Confrontation, released posthumously in
                        1983, contained unreleased material recorded during Marley's lifetime, including the hit "Buffalo
                        Soldier" and new mixes of singles previously only available in Jamaica.</li>
                    <li><b>Illness and death</b><br>In July 1977, Marley was found to have a type of malignant melanoma
                        under the nail of a toe. Contrary to urban legend, this lesion was not primarily caused by an injury
                        during a football match that year but was instead a symptom of already-existing cancer. He had to
                        see two doctors before a biopsy was made, which confirmed the deadliest kind of skin cancer: acral
                        lentiginous melanoma. Unlike other melanomas, usually on skin exposed to the sun, acral lentiginous
                        melanoma occurs in places that are easy to miss, such as the soles of the feet, or under toenails.
                        Although it is the commonest melanoma in people with dark skin, it is not widely recognised, and was
                        not mentioned in the most popular medical textbook of the time.[63]

                        Marley turned down his doctors' advice to have his toe amputated (which would have hindered his
                        performing career), citing his religious beliefs, and instead, the nail and nail bed were removed
                        and a skin graft was taken from his thigh to cover the area.[64][65] Despite his illness, he
                        continued touring and was in the process of scheduling a world tour in 1980.[66]

                        The album Uprising was released in May 1980. The band completed a major tour of Europe, where it
                        played its biggest concert to 100,000 people in Milan, Italy. After the tour Marley went to the
                        United States, where he performed two shows at Madison Square Garden in New York City as part of the
                        Uprising Tour.[67] He collapsed while jogging in Central Park and was taken to hospital, where it
                        was found that his cancer had spread to his brain, lungs, and liver.[68]

                        Marley's last concert took place two days later at the Stanley Theater (now The Benedum Center For
                        The Performing Arts) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on 23 September 1980.

                        The only known photographs from the show were included in Kevin Macdonald's documentary film Marley.

                        saying:</b>
                    <br>
                    "His voice was an omnipresent cry in our electronic world. His sharp features, majestic looks, and
                    prancing style a vivid etching on the landscape of our minds. Bob Marley was never seen. He was an
                    experience which left an indelible imprint with each encounter. Such a man cannot be erased from the
                    mind. He is part of the collective consciousness of the nation." </p>
